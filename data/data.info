The provided data set is a modification of the UCI cover type data set with a couple important transformations
	* We have removed all but two classification
		Spruce/Fir = 0
		Lodgepole Pine = 1
	* We have collapsed the original 40 binary columns for soil type down to one column Soil_Type
	* We have collapsed the original 4 binary columns for wilderness area down to one column Wilderness_Area
